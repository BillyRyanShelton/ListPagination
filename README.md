# ListPagination
The following repository contains code to paginate a list of items.
This project follows the concept of progressive enhancement and unobtrusive Javascript to paginate the list of students and create a search function dynamically. 
The index.html file runs perfectly fine without the script.js file but with it, the user
experience is enchanced.
